This one of the first real(ish) projects I had ever done. I had just finished working through the [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist in Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html) book and I wanted to try building that I would actually use. One problem I frequently faced as a former windows user, was malware infecting my USB after using them on computers in college. So one day while commuting home with a possibly infected USB, I thought of this program.    
<br/>

Essentially, this utility when run, gets a list of all files and folders in the current directory and in sub-directories. Then, it generates a SHA256 hash on each file found, encrypts this hash and finally adds the hash and stores it in the file ```hashstore.enil``` in the current directory. Finally it generates what I call a ```master hash```, i.e. it concatenates all the file hashes and hashes the resulting string. This ```master hash``` is then appended to the ```hashstore.enil``` file.  
<br/>

On subsequent runs of the utility, the file hashes and master hash are recalculated. Then the hashes from the ```hashstore.enil``` are decrypted. If the current ```master hash``` and the stored ```master hash``` match, then the files have not been modified. If the two master hashes are different, then newly generated hash list and the hash list from the ```hashstore.enil``` are compared, and the user in notified of which files have been modified and which files have been newly added.  
<br/>

At this point the user can choose to exit or update the ```hashstore.enil```

There's a lot projects ideas that come to me when I should be working on something else or when I should be sleeping. So rather than wasting time thinking about projects, I'll keep a list of projects I want to get to here.
They are, in no particular order:  

- kanban board in js
- learn how to write a programming language from scratch
- write a markdown to html parser in js
- build a simple database software from scratch
- ~~build a simple irc-like chat web client~~
- ml model deployed on this site
